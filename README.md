# Retail Sales Performance Analytics (End-to-End)

An end-to-end data analytics project demonstrating the transition from raw transactional data to actionable business insights using SQL and modern BI tools.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales performance to identify key growth drivers and evaluate the effectiveness of promotional strategies. The analysis focuses on profitability metrics, volume trends, and margin optimization.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
- **Cloud Warehouse:** Snowflake
- **Data Modeling:** SQL (CTE & Window Functions)
- **Visualization:** PowerBI
- **Data Source:** Retail transaction dataset (CSV)

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/data`: Raw transactional data and data dictionary.
- `/sql`: Snowflake SQL scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and KPI development.
- `/reports`: Exported PowerBI dashboards and executive summaries.

## 📈 Key Insights & Results
